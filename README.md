# assignment-03 Shopsmart Central

## Description
ShopSmart Central is an e-commerce platform designed to provide a seamless shopping experience similar to Amazon. Users can browse through a wide range of products, add items to their cart, place orders, and write reviews for products they have purchased. The platform aims to offer a user-friendly interface and robust functionality to meet the needs of customers.

## Deployment
ShopSmart Central is deployed using Render for the backend and Vercel for the frontend. 
If it is your first time to visit the website, you should wait about one minutes for the Render to be active since free Render instance will spin down with inactivity, which can delay requests by 50 seconds or more. After the website is being active, you should refresh the website.
